## WP1: Multi-modal nanoparticle networks

#### Nanoparticle Networks respond in more than one modality (e.g. electrical, photonic, ...)

**Goal:** Multiple functions for the same set of electrode voltages but different external stimuli

**Training:** Monte Carlo Sampling, Genetic Algorithm, off-chip Surrogate Models, *in-situ* gradient decent *in materia*

**Benchmark:** Boolean Logic, MNIST, CIFAR-10, **Vapnik-Chervonenski (VC) dimension**

#### Simulation:

- [ ] Photo-responsive system **&rarr;** sudden change in resistances of the NP network
- [ ] steady-state **&rarr;** time dependent currents **&rarr;** steady-state 
- [ ] Degree of non-exponentiality of the response function **&rarr;** network complexity
- [ ] 2 Functionalities (one before (A), one after switching (B)), 
potential definition of fitness via $min(F_A, F_B)$
- [ ] minimum number of control electrodes?
- [ ] study of joint distribution of NDR or NLS current combinations
- [ ] Again Monte Carlo Sampling or *in-situ* gradient decent *in materia*
