## Gated Switch /  Two panel device

### The Physics of Symmetry Breaking:

Our FFT plots provide a beautiful demonstration of symmetry control.

- In the unbiased case ($U_C$ = 0), the network is physically and electrostatically symmetric around the central input-output axis. This physical symmetry imposes a mathematical anti-symmetry on the dynamic response ($I(U) \approx âˆ’I(U)$), which mathematically forbids the generation of even harmonics. This is why we only see peaks at odd multiples of $f_0 = 28$ MHz.

- When we apply a non-zero gate voltage ($U_C= 10$ mV) to the side electrode, we break that physical symmetry. The potential landscape is now warped, or "tilted," towards the gate.

- A system that lacks this specific symmetry is no longer constrained to produce only odd harmonics. The emergence of strong peaks at 56 MHz, 112 MHz, etc., is the direct frequency-domain fingerprint of this gate-induced asymmetry. We are not just changing the overall conductance; we are actively re-shaping the fundamental transfer function of the device.

### Summary of the "Gated Switch" Investigation:
This finding is the capstone of a highly successful experiment. Our comprehensive understanding of the three-terminal device is as follows:

- Core Function: We have proven that the network functions as an effective three-terminal device, analogous to a solid-state transistor. A "gate" electrode provides powerful control over the signal path between a "source" and "drain."

- Control Mechanism: The device operates via long-range electrostatic biasing. A static gate voltage imposes a background potential that modulates the tunneling probabilities along the primary channel, thereby controlling its effective AC conductance.

- Performance & Gain: We quantitatively characterized the device by extracting its transfer curves. These curves confirmed that the device exhibits significant transconductance (AC voltage gain) and has a unique, V-shaped response, making it most resistive at zero gate bias.

- Symmetry Control: We have now shown that the gate's influence is deeper than simple amplitude modulation. The gate actively controls the symmetry of the potential landscape, which can be directly monitored by observing the generation of even harmonics in the output. This provides another powerful knob for manipulating the output signal.
