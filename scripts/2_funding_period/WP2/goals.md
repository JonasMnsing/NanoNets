## WP2: Dynamic nanoparticle networks

#### NP that exhibit dynamic behavior to process time-dependent signals. Output and network state not only depends on the present inputs but also previous inputs.

**Goal:** Process time series data

**Training:** Recurrent Neural Network Training, Reinforcment Learning, Monte Carlo Sampling, Reservoir Computing, (LSTM?)

**Benchmark:** Auidio, Video, medical data (ECG, EEG)

#### Simulation:

- [ ] Heterogeneities statistically or systematically:
    - [ ] disordered topologies
    - [ ] disordered resistances
    - [ ] disordered NP sizes / electrostatic properties
    - [ ] spatially correlated network properties (resistances)
- [ ] Heterogeneities and their impact on NDR/NLS
- [ ] High resistances decrease impact of control electrodes?
- [ ] Output response to input step function and modification due to heterogeneities
- [ ] Somehow forecast / model time series data
